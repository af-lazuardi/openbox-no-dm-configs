# openbox-no-dm-configs

This is my custom configs for linux with openbox window manager without login manager. Openbox will startup immediately after login, or after booting if the autologin mode is enabled. Current configs include autostart command to set the background into full black "#000000" and some keybindings to execute xterm and dmenu_run. For more information about openbox configurations, check [Openbox: Configuration](http://openbox.org/wiki/Help:Configuration).
